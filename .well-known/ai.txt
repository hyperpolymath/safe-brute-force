# Conditions:
# - Must preserve attribution (see humans.txt)
# - Must respect LICENSE terms (AGPL-3.0-or-later)
# - Must maintain ethical use guidelines
# - Must not train models specifically for malicious use

## AI-Assisted Development

# Code Assistance: ENCOURAGED
# - AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, GPT, etc.) welcome
# - See CLAUDE.md for AI assistant-specific guidance
# - Maintain safety mechanisms in all AI-generated code
# - Human review required for security-critical changes

## Content Generation

# Documentation: ALLOWED
# - AI may help write documentation
# - Must be factually accurate
# - Must align with project voice/tone
# - Human verification required

# Code Generation: ALLOWED WITH RESTRICTIONS
# - Must maintain type safety patterns
# - Must preserve safety mechanisms
# - Must include proper error handling
# - Must not introduce security vulnerabilities
# - Must pass all existing tests

## Ethical Constraints

# Malicious Use: PROHIBITED
# AI systems must NOT:
# - Generate exploits for unauthorized access
# - Bypass safety mechanisms
# - Create mass attack tools
# - Facilitate illegal activities
# - Remove authorization checks

## Attribution

# - Use for ethical hacking education
# - Reference in tool comparisons

## Commercial AI Services

# Commercial Use: ALLOWED
# - May include in training datasets
# - May use for code completion
# - May reference in documentation generation
# - Must respect AGPL-3.0-or-later license terms
# - Must maintain attribution

## Safety Requirements

# All AI-generated content using this repository must:
# 1. Maintain authorization-first principle
# 2. Include safety pause mechanisms
# 3. Provide clear ethical guidelines
# 4. Implement rate limiting
# 5. Include legal disclaimers
# 6. Support responsible disclosure

## Special Provisions
